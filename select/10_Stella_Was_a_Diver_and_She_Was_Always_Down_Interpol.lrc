[00:00.05] This one's called "Stella Was a Diver and She's Always Down'"
[00:30.55] 
[00:19.20] When she walks down the street
[00:23.04] She knows there's people watching
[00:27.41] The building fronts are just fronts
[00:31.69] To hide the people watching her
[00:47.19] 
[00:35.96] But she once fell through the street
[00:39.83] Down a manhole in that bad way
[00:44.33] The underground drip
[00:48.54] Was just like her scuba days
[01:02.54] 
[00:55.19] Days
[00:59.54] Daze
[01:03.78] Days
[01:07.94] Daze
[01:12.14] Days
[01:14.14] 
[01:16.29] She was all right 'cause the sea was so airtight, she broke away
[01:22.59] She was all right 'cause the sea was so airtight, she broke away
[01:28.96] She was all right, but she can't come out tonight, she broke away
[01:35.44] She was all right 'cause the sea was so tight, airtight
[01:43.52] She broke away, broke away
[01:49.84] She broke away, broke away
[01:58.27] She broke away, broke away
[02:04.45] She broke away
[02:11.45] 
[02:18.96] She lies in no place
[02:23.01] She lies in nowhere
[02:27.47] She lies in no place
[02:31.70] She hides in nowhere
[02:34.10] She hides in nowhere
[02:44.10] 
[02:40.87] At the bottom of the ocean, she dwells
[02:45.19] At the bottom of the ocean, she dwells
[02:49.38] From crevices caressed by fingers
[02:53.52] And fat blue serpent swells
[02:58.82] Stella, Stella, oh, Stella
[03:13.07] Stella, I love you, Stella, I love you, Stella, I love you
[03:42.07] 
[03:21.46] She was all right 'cause the sea was so airtight, she broke away
[03:27.84] She was all right 'cause the sea was so airtight, she broke away
[03:34.17] She was all right, but she can't come out tonight, she broke away
[03:40.61] She was all right, yeah, the sea was so tight, airtight
[03:48.76] She broke away, broke away
[03:55.19] She broke away, broke away
[04:03.56] She broke away, broke away
[04:09.75] She broke away
[04:16.75] 
[04:39.34] Well, she was my catatonic sex toy, love-joy diver
[04:47.65] Well, she was my catatonic sex toy, love drug diver
[04:55.10] She went down, down, down there into the sea
[04:59.58] Yeah, she went down, down, down there
[05:02.14] Down there for me, right on
[05:15.64] 
[05:07.10] Oh, yeah, right on
[05:16.14] So good, oh, yeah, right on
[05:28.69] So good, oh yeah
[05:36.69] 
[05:36.91] There's something that's invisible
[05:41.16] There's some things you can't hide
[05:44.75] Trying to detect you when I'm sleeping
[05:49.06] In a wave you say goodbye
[05:53.82] There's something that's invisible
[05:58.05] There's some things you can't hide
[06:01.64] Trying to detect you when I'm sleeping
[06:06.03] In a wave you say goodbye
