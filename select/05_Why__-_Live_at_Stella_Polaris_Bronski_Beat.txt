Tell me why
Tell me why

Contempt in your eyes
When I turn to kiss his lips
Broken I lie
All my feelings denied
Blood on your fist

Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?

Whooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

You in your false securities
Tear up my life
Condemning me
Name me an illness
You call me a sin
Never feel guilty
Never give in

Tell me why?
Tell me why?
Tell me why?
Tell me why?
Yeah!

Yeeaah!

You and me together
Fighting for our love
You and me together
Fighting for our love
You and me together
Fighting for our love
You and me together
Fighting for our love
You and me together
Fighting for our love
You and me together
Fighting for our love
You and me together
Fighting for our love
You and me together
Fighting for our love

Oooo-ooh

Contempt in your eyes
When I turn to kiss his lips
Broken I lie
All my feelings denied
Blood on your fist

Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
